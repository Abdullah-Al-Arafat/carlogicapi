# Car Logic API
A project to help make the roads a smarter and safer place

## Description
Our vision: cars, trucks, buses, intersections, even the street itself should eventually be able to communicate and collaborate to improve efficiency and safety without compromising personal security or safety.

The project we are proposing includes developing prototype communication standards, and a proof of concept as to how they would be used. Seeing as we will not be implementing this software in actual cars, we will need to leverage an existing open-source traffic simulation engine to develop and test our work. See the list of open source traffic sims below.

## Audience
Traffic engineers and car manufacturers are the main audience for this project. Traffic engineers will be interested in the potential traffic efficiency gains of the project. The project will work best when it is fully integrated into cars, this requires the cooperation of the car manufacturers. They could market the technology as a safety and efficiency feature. Ultimately, as cars become smarter and computers are more tightly integrated with the driving experience, solutions like this will optimize and improve driving for all people who own such a car.

## Proposed Timeline
The goal to achieve by the end of the semester is a working demo of two or more simulated “smart cars” communicating to improve safety and efficiency.

Step 1: design algorithms and specify data requirements
Step 2: William: Decide on which traffic sim to use. Greg: Design communication layer
Step 3: Produce prototypes of algorithms and communication layer
Step 4: Integrate two parts into demo (in sim?)
